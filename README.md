This is the Team Formation App.

## Description

name: Team Formation  
blurb: Our app Teamation designs to make forming students into teams for a group project convenient for professors while also fair and effective for the students. Our app does this by separating the group making process into four processes: project brainstorming, voting, preference creation, and finally group creation.
